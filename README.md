# Sarah-s-Space-Website
First website; about my interests; links to favorite content
After completing a training module on HTML and CSS to create a travel website using div, cards, and flex box, this is my attempt to apply those skills into my own website using the travel website as a model. The framework of the website will be mostly identical to the model except that I am adding an extra nav link and an extra flex box inside for two links inside the hero content.
